# AICO Connectors

AICO Connectors provide REST APIs for integrating with external workshop management and booking systems. Each connector is a standalone microservice that handles authentication, data synchronization, and business operations for its target system.

## Architecture Overview

Each connector follows a consistent architecture:

- **Local Caching**: SQLite or in-memory storage for fast queries
- **Background Sync**: Automatic data synchronization with source systems
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs for traceability
